# Retro-style Solana NFT Game Player

This is a website that lets you play gb roms from NFTs owned in a wallet. Based on an idea from [Shanksy](https://twitter.com/0xShanksy?s=20)
and inspired by https://drip.haus.

## Getting With the website 

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
